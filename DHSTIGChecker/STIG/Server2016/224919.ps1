Rule Title: Windows Server 2016 must be configured to ignore NetBIOS name release requests except from WINS servers.
Discussion:
Configuring the system to ignore name release requests, except from WINS servers, prevents a denial of service (DoS) attack. The DoS consists of sending a NetBIOS name release request to the server for each entry in the server's cache, causing a response delay in the normal operation of the server's WINS resolution capability.
