STIG:       Microsoft Windows Server 2016 Security Technical Implementation Guide :: Version 2, Release: 6 Benchmark Date: 11 May 2023

Rule Title: Software certificate installation files must be removed from Windows Server 2016.
Discussion:
Use of software certificates and their accompanying installation files for end users to access resources is less secure than the use of hardware-based certificates.


Check Content:
Search all drives for *.p12 and *.pfx files.

If any files with these extensions exist, this is a finding.

This does not apply to server-based applications that have a requirement for .p12 certificate files or Adobe PreFlight certificate files. Some applications create files with extensions of .p12 that are not certificate installation files. Removal of non-certificate installation files from systems is not required. These must be documented with the ISSO.
