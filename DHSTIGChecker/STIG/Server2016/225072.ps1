STIG:       Microsoft Windows Server 2016 Security Technical Implementation Guide :: Version 2, Release: 6 Benchmark Date: 11 May 2023
Severity:   medium
Vuln ID:    V-225072
Rule ID:    SV-225072r569186_rule
STIG ID:    WN16-UR-000050
Legacy:     V-73739; SV-88403
Rule Title: The Allow log on locally user right must only be assigned to the Administrators group.
Discussion:
Inappropriate granting of user rights can provide system, administrative, and other high-level capabilities.

Accounts with the "Allow log on locally" user right can log on interactively to a system.


Check Content:
Verify the effective setting in Local Group Policy Editor.

Run "gpedit.msc".

Navigate to Local Computer Policy >> Computer Configuration >> Windows Settings >> Security Settings >> Local Policies >> User Rights Assignment.

If any accounts or groups other than the following are granted the "Allow log on locally" user right, this is a finding.

- Administrators

For server core installations, run the following command:

Secedit /Export /Areas User_Rights /cfg c:\path\filename.txt

Review the text file.

If any SIDs other than the following are granted the "SeInteractiveLogonRight" user right, this is a finding.

S-1-5-32-544 (Administrators)

If an application requires this user right, this would not be a finding.

Vendor documentation must support the requirement for having the user right.

The requirement must be documented with the ISSO.

The application account must meet requirements for application account passwords, such as length (WN16-00-000060) and required frequency of changes (WN16-00-000070).
