Severity:   medium
Vuln ID:    V-224947
Rule ID:    SV-224947r877394_rule

Rule Title: The Remote Desktop Session Host must require secure Remote Procedure Call (RPC) communications.
Discussion:
Allowing unsecure RPC communication exposes the system to man-in-the-middle attacks and data disclosure attacks. A man-in-the-middle attack occurs when an intruder captures packets between a client and server and modifies them before allowing the packets to be exchanged. Usually the attacker will modify the information in the packets in an attempt to cause either the client or server to reveal sensitive information.
