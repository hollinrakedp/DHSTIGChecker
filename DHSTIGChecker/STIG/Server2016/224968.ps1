Rule Title: The Kerberos policy user ticket renewal maximum lifetime must be limited to seven days or less.
Discussion:
This setting determines the period of time (in days) during which a user's Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) may be renewed. This security configuration limits the amount of time an attacker has to crack the TGT and gain access.

Satisfies: SRG-OS-000112-GPOS-00057, SRG-OS-000113-GPOS-00058
