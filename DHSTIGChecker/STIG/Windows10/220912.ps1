Vuln ID:    V-220912

Rule Title: The built-in guest account must be renamed.
Discussion:
The built-in guest account is a well-known user account on all Windows systems and, as initially installed, does not require a password.  This can allow access to system resources by unauthorized users.  Renaming this account to an unidentified name improves the protection of this account and the system.


Check Content:
Verify the effective setting in Local Group Policy Editor.
Run "gpedit.msc".

Navigate to Local Computer Policy >> Computer Configuration >> Windows Settings >> Security Settings >> Local Policies >> Security Options.

If the value for "Accounts: Rename guest account" is set to "Guest", this is a finding.
