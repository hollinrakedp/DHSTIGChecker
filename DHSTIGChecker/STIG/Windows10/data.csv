Multifactor authentication requires using two or more factors to achieve authentication.

Factors include: 

1) Something a user knows (e.g., password/PIN);

2) Something a user has (e.g., cryptographic identification device, token); and

3) Something a user is (e.g., biometric).

A privileged account is defined as an information system account with authorizations of a privileged user.

Network access is defined as access to an information system by a user (or a process acting on behalf of a user) communicating through a network (e.g., local area network, wide area network, or the internet).

Local access is defined as access to an organizational information system by a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) communicating through a direct connection without the use of a network.

If ""SecurityServicesRunning"" does not include a value of ""2"" (e.g., ""{1, 2}""), this is a finding.

Alternately:

Run ""System Information"".

Under ""System Summary"", verify the following:
If ""Virtualization-based Security Services Running"" does not list ""Hypervisor enforced Code Integrity"", this is finding.

The policy settings referenced in the Fix section will configure the following registry value. However due to hardware requirements, the registry value alone does not ensure proper function.

Registry Hive: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
Registry Path: \SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\DeviceGuard\

Value Name: HypervisorEnforcedCodeIntegrity
Value Type: REG_DWORD
Value: 0x00000001 (1) (Enabled with UEFI lock), or 0x00000002 (2) (Enabled without lock)","Virtualization-based security currently cannot be implemented in VDIs due to specific supporting requirements, including a TPM, UEFI with Secure Boot, and the capability to run the Hyper-V feature within the virtual desktop.

For VDIs where the virtual desktop instance is deleted or refreshed upon logoff, this is NA.

Configure the policy value for Computer Configuration >> Administrative Templates >> System >> Device Guard >> ""Turn On Virtualization Based Security"" to ""Enabled"" with ""Enabled with UEFI lock"" or ""Enabled without lock"" selected for ""Virtualization Based Protection of Code Integrity:"".

""Enabled with UEFI lock"" is preferred as more secure; however, it cannot be turned off remotely through a group policy change if there is an issue.

""Enabled without lock"" will allow this to be turned off remotely while testing for issues.","","","false","","","","","","","M","Unclass","Microsoft Windows 10 Security Technical Implementation Guide :: Version 2, Release: 6 Benchmark Date: 11 May 2023","Not Reviewed","","","","","CCI-000366
