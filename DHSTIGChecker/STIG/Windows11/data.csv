Multifactor authentication requires using two or more factors to achieve authentication.

Factors include: 

1) Something a user knows (e.g., password/PIN);

2) Something a user has (e.g., cryptographic identification device, token); and

3) Something a user is (e.g., biometric).

A privileged account is defined as an information system account with authorizations of a privileged user.

Network access is defined as access to an information system by a user (or a process acting on behalf of a user) communicating through a network (e.g., local area network, wide area network, or the internet).

Local access is defined as access to an organizational information system by a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) communicating through a direct connection without the use of a network.
