STIG:       Microsoft Windows Server 2019 Security Technical Implementation Guide :: Version 2, Release: 6 Benchmark Date: 11 May 2023
Severity:   medium
Vuln ID:    V-205751
Rule ID:    SV-205751r877392_rule
STIG ID:    WN19-UR-000040
Legacy:     V-93053; SV-103141
Rule Title: Windows Server 2019 Back up files and directories user right must only be assigned to the Administrators group.
Discussion:
Inappropriate granting of user rights can provide system, administrative, and other high-level capabilities.

Accounts with the "Back up files and directories" user right can circumvent file and directory permissions and could allow access to sensitive data.


Check Content:
Verify the effective setting in Local Group Policy Editor.

Run "gpedit.msc".

Navigate to Local Computer Policy >> Computer Configuration >> Windows Settings >> Security Settings >> Local Policies >> User Rights Assignment.

If any accounts or groups other than the following are granted the "Back up files and directories" user right, this is a finding:

- Administrators

For server core installations, run the following command:

Secedit /Export /Areas User_Rights /cfg c:\path\filename.txt

Review the text file.

If any SIDs other than the following are granted the "SeBackupPrivilege" user right, this is a finding:

S-1-5-32-544 (Administrators)

If an application requires this user right, this would not be a finding.

Vendor documentation must support the requirement for having the user right.

The requirement must be documented with the ISSO.

The application account must meet requirements for application account passwords, such as length (WN19-00-000050) and required frequency of changes (WN19-00-000060).
