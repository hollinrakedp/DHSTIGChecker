Rule Title: Windows Server 2019 must be configured to audit DS Access - Directory Service Changes successes.
Discussion:
Maintaining an audit trail of system activity logs can help identify configuration errors, troubleshoot service disruptions, and analyze compromises that have occurred, as well as detect attacks. Audit logs are necessary to provide a trail of evidence in case the system or network is compromised. Collecting this data is essential for analyzing the security of information assets and detecting signs of suspicious and unexpected behavior.

Audit Directory Service Changes records events related to changes made to objects in Active Directory Domain Services.
