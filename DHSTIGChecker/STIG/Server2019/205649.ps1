STIG:       Microsoft Windows Server 2019 Security Technical Implementation Guide :: Version 2, Release: 6 Benchmark Date: 11 May 2023
Severity:   medium
Vuln ID:    V-205649
Rule ID:    SV-205649r894615_rule
STIG ID:    WN19-PK-000020
Legacy:     V-93489; SV-103575
Rule Title: Windows Server 2019 must have the DoD Interoperability Root Certificate Authority (CA) cross-certificates installed in the Untrusted Certificates Store on unclassified systems.
Discussion:
To ensure users do not experience denial of service when performing certificate-based authentication to DoD websites due to the system chaining to a root other than DoD Root CAs, the DoD Interoperability Root CA cross-certificates must be installed in the Untrusted Certificate Store. This requirement only applies to unclassified systems.

Satisfies: SRG-OS-000066-GPOS-00034, SRG-OS-000403-GPOS-00182


Check Content:
This is applicable to unclassified systems. It is NA for others.

Open "PowerShell" as an administrator.

Execute the following command:

Get-ChildItem -Path Cert:Localmachine\disallowed | Where {$_.Issuer -Like "*DoD Interoperability*" -and $_.Subject -Like "*DoD*"} | FL Subject, Issuer, Thumbprint, NotAfter

If the following certificate "Subject", "Issuer", and "Thumbprint" information is not displayed, this is a finding. 

Subject: CN=DoD Root CA 3, OU=PKI, OU=DoD, O=U.S. Government, C=US
Issuer: CN=DoD Interoperability Root CA 2, OU=PKI, OU=DoD, O=U.S. Government, C=US
Thumbprint: 49CBE933151872E17C8EAE7F0ABA97FB610F6477
NotAfter: 11/16/2024 9:57:16 AM

Select "Computer account" and click "Next".

Select "Local computer: (the computer this console is running on)" and click "Finish".

Click "OK".

Expand "Certificates" and navigate to Untrusted Certificates >> Certificates.

For each certificate with "DoD Root CA..." under "Issued To" and "DoD Interoperability Root CA..." under "Issued By":

Right-click on the certificate and select "Open".

Select the "Details" tab.

Scroll to the bottom and select "Thumbprint".

If the certificate below is not listed or the value for the "Thumbprint" field is not as noted, this is a finding. 

Issued to: DoD Root CA 3
Issued By: DoD Interoperability Root CA 2
Thumbprint: 49CBE933151872E17C8EAE7F0ABA97FB610F6477
