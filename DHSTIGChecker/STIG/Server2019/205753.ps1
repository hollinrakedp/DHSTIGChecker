STIG:       Microsoft Windows Server 2019 Security Technical Implementation Guide :: Version 2, Release: 6 Benchmark Date: 11 May 2023
Severity:   high
Vuln ID:    V-205753
Rule ID:    SV-205753r877392_rule
STIG ID:    WN19-UR-000060

Rule Title: Windows Server 2019 Create a token object user right must not be assigned to any groups or accounts.
Discussion:
Inappropriate granting of user rights can provide system, administrative, and other high-level capabilities.

The "Create a token object" user right allows a process to create an access token. This could be used to provide elevated rights and compromise a system.


Check Content:
Verify the effective setting in Local Group Policy Editor.

Run "gpedit.msc".

Navigate to Local Computer Policy >> Computer Configuration >> Windows Settings >> Security Settings >> Local Policies >> User Rights Assignment.

If any accounts or groups are granted the "Create a token object" user right, this is a finding.

For server core installations, run the following command:

Secedit /Export /Areas User_Rights /cfg c:\path\filename.txt

Review the text file.

If any SIDs are granted the "SeCreateTokenPrivilege" user right, this is a finding.

If an application requires this user right, this would not be a finding.

Vendor documentation must support the requirement for having the user right.

The requirement must be documented with the ISSO.

The application account must meet requirements for application account passwords, such as length (WN19-00-000050) and required frequency of changes (WN19-00-000060).

Passwords for application accounts with this user right must be protected as highly privileged accounts.
