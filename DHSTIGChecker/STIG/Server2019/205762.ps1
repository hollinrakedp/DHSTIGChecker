Rule Title: Windows Server 2019 Load and unload device drivers user right must only be assigned to the Administrators group.
Discussion:
Inappropriate granting of user rights can provide system, administrative, and other high-level capabilities.

The "Load and unload device drivers" user right allows a user to load device drivers dynamically on a system. This could be used by an attacker to install malicious code.


Check Content:
Verify the effective setting in Local Group Policy Editor.

Run "gpedit.msc".

Navigate to Local Computer Policy >> Computer Configuration >> Windows Settings >> Security Settings >> Local Policies >> User Rights Assignment.

If any accounts or groups other than the following are granted the "Load and unload device drivers" user right, this is a finding:

- Administrators

For server core installations, run the following command:

Secedit /Export /Areas User_Rights /cfg c:\path\filename.txt

Review the text file.

If any SIDs other than the following are granted the "SeLoadDriverPrivilege" user right, this is a finding:

S-1-5-32-544 (Administrators)
#>

$GrantedPrivilege = ($Script:CurrentSecPolicy.SeLoadDriverPrivilege -split ',').trimstart('*')

$Allowed = @($Script:SIDLocalGroup.Administrators)

$Local:Results = @()

foreach ($ID in $GrantedPrivilege) {
    $Local:Results += if ($Allowed -contains $ID ) {
        $true
    }
    else {
        $false
    }
}

if ($Local:Results -contains $false) {
    $false
}
else {
    $true
}
